    <p>
    Assalam-o-Alaikum! I'm <span id="name">Abdur Razaq</span>, a passionate <span id="student">Computer Science student</span> with a strong interest in
    programming and technology.
     <br>
    I enjoy solving problems and have experience working with C, C++, and core Python. I'm currently focused on building
    my skills in web development, with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer. One day, I aim to create and run my
    own remote tech company, where I can bring innovative ideas to life.
   <br>
    Outside of tech, I’m committed to self-discipline and personal growth — you’ll often find me at the gym, staying
    active and focused.
