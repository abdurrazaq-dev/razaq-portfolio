    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Services I offer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Web Page Design (HTML/CSS):</li>
        I can build responsive and visually clean web pages using HTML5 and CSS3. 
        Whether it's a landing page, portfolio, or a basic static website.
         I focus on clean layout and structure.
         <li> Front-End Components:</li>
         I create simple and reusable front-end components like navigation bars,
          buttons, and card layouts —
          perfect for beginners and practice projects.
          <li>Problem Solving:</li>
          I solve programming problems in C++ and Python — building logic
          and practicing algorithms.
           I can help with basic scripts, beginner-level logic building, and debugging.
        <li>Learning & Growth Services:</li>
        I'm currently learning full-stack development.
         If you're also starting out, I can collaborate on beginner-friendly
         coding projects or learning together.
